Version 0.9.0 - 29 Sep 2003
	-- Renumbered to reflect that it's not been realworld tested
	-- changed package to danga.com.MemCached (thanks)
	-- added dates to changelog
	-- added .txt to text files
	-- added to official memcached site :)

Version 1.0.0 - 28 Sep 2003
	-- Adjusted namespacing for SockIO, it shouldn't have been public; is now package level.
		As a bonus, this means I don't have to Javadoc it. :)
	-- Finished adding complete Javadoc to MemCachedClient.
	-- spellchecked
	-- added a couple versions of function variations that I missed. for example, some that
		didn't take an int directly as a hash value, and i missed a get_multi w/out hashes.
	-- removed java.net.Socket reference from MemCachedClient, SockIO has a new constructor which
		takes hostname and port number
	-- switched to three part version number



Version 0.3 - 27 Sep 2003
	-- Compression, for strings/stringified numbers, this is compatible w/ perl
		Serialized objects are incompatible w/ perl for obvious reasons. :)
	-- Added PORTABILITY file, to include information about using the client
		with various JVM's
	-- Updated string parsing to StreamTokenizer rather than regexp's in an 
		effort to get sablevm to like the client

Version 0.2 - 24 Sep 2003
	-- Serialization works
	-- Possible BUG: Only the lower byte of the characters of keys are sent
		This is only a problem if the memcache server can handle
		unicode keys. (I haven't checked)
	-- Server Failures handled gracefully
	-- Partial Javadoc

Version 0.1 - 23 Sep 2003
	-- Initial Release
	-- Storing and Retrieving numbers and strings works
